# Suggested Improvements for MMEX Kivy Application

After reviewing your MMEX Kivy application code, here are several improvement suggestions:

## User Interface Enhancements

1. Add Search/Filter Functionality : Implement a search box to filter 
   transactions by payee, category, or notes.
2. Data Visualization : Add simple charts or graphs to visualize spending by 
   category or over time.
3. Sortable Columns : Make the transaction grid columns sortable by clicking on headers.
4. Responsive Layout : Improve the responsiveness for different screen sizes 
   using size_hint properties more effectively.
5. Date Picker Widget : Replace text inputs for dates with a proper date picker 
   widget for better user experience.
6. Transaction Details View : Add ability to click on a transaction to see more 
   details or edit it.

## Performance Improvements

1. Connection Pooling : Implement database connection pooling instead of opening/closing connections for each query.
2. Pagination : Add pagination for large result sets instead of loading all transactions at once.
3. Asynchronous Loading : Use threading or async operations for database queries to prevent UI freezing.

## Code Structure and Organization

1. 1.

4. 4.
   Config Management : Add a settings screen to configure database path and other options instead of using .env files.
5. 5.
   Fix Duplicate Refresh Button : There are two identical refresh buttons in the date_input_layout.
## Additional Features
1. 1.
   Export Functionality : Add ability to export transactions to CSV or PDF.
